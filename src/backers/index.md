# Support Cement Development

The Cement Framework is Open Source and released under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause" target="_blank">3-Clause BSD License</a>, making it completely free to use.  As with any open source project, a tremendous amount of time and effort is required in order to properly maintain current versions, and to make future versions and features possible.

Any contribution is greatly appreciated, whether it be a simple email to say "thank you", a nice bottle of liquor, or by a financial commitment.  You can support the development of Cement by way of a one-time gift through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/datafolklabs), or a monthly sponsorship via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/datafolklabs).

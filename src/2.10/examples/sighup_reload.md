A common convention in the Linux world is to handle a SIGHUP signal, by reloading the current runtime within the same process ID (pid). The following example demonstrates how you might achieve that:

```python
import signal
from time import sleep
from cement.core.foundation import CementApp
from cement.core.controller import CementBaseController, expose
from cement.core.exc import CaughtSignal


class MyController(CementBaseController):
    class Meta:
        label = 'base'

    @expose(hide=True)
    def default(self):
        print('Inside MyController.default()')

        ### inner loop where the application logic happens
        while True:
            print('Inside Inner Loop')
            sleep(5)

class MyApp(CementApp):
    class Meta:
        label = 'myapp'
        base_controller = MyController


with MyApp() as app:
    ### outer loop where signals are handles, and application reload
    ### happens

    keep_alive = True
    while keep_alive is True:
        try:
            app.run()
        except CaughtSignal as e:
            app.log.warning(e.msg)
            if e.signum in [signal.SIGHUP]:
                app.log.warning('Reloading MyApp')
                app.reload()
                keep_alive = True
            else:
                app.exit_code = 1
                keep_alive = False
```

Running the application shows the inner loop in action:

```
$ python myapp.py
Inside MyController.default()
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
```


If we grab the PID in another terminal, and send it a SIGHUP signal we can see it reload:

```
$ ps | grep [m]yapp
1317    python myapp.py

$ kill -HUP 1317
```

In the original terminal (running our app) we see that the app reloads and the inner loop continues:

```
Caught signal 1
WARNING: Reloading myapp
Inside MyController.default()
Inside Inner Loop
Inside Inner Loop
```

However, the PID remains the same:

```
$ ps | grep [m]yapp
1317    python myapp.py
```

If youâ€™d like to see even more detail on what Cement is doing during the reload try adding `--debug`.
